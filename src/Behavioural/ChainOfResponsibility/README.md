# Chain of Responsibility

## Definition

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a design pattern that allows multiple objects to handle a request, either individually or by passing the request along the chain. This pattern can be useful for decoupling the sender of a request from the receiver, allowing for greater flexibility in code.

## Example Scenario

Let's consider a real-world example of the Chain of Responsibility pattern in C#. Imagine you're developing a purchase approval system where a purchase request must pass through different levels of approval, such as manager, director, and CEO.

1. Create an abstract class that represents the handler.
2. Create concrete classes that implement the handler.

# Strategy

## Description

The strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use. It promotes the use of multiple algorithms interchangeably and enhances the flexibility and maintainability of the code.

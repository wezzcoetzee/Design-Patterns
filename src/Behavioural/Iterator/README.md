# Iterator

## Definition

The Iterator Pattern is a design pattern that provides a way to traverse through a collection of objects without exposing the underlying representation. In C#, the Iterator Pattern can be easily implemented using the `IEnumerable` and `IEnumerator` interfaces.

## Example Scenario

1. Create the base class.
2. Create the collection.
3. Instantiate the collection.

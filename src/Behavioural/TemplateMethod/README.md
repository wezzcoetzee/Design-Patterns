# Template Method

## Definition

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and allows subclasses to override certain steps without changing the overall structure of the algorithm.

## Example Scenario

Lets take the example of a food delivery service.

1. Define a base class for the food delivery service
2. Define a concrete class for each type of food delivery service

 # Interpreter
 
## Definition

The Interpreter pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions. It involves defining a representation for the grammar and an interpreter to process it. In a real-world example, we could use the Interpreter pattern to create a simple calculator that interprets arithmetic expressions.

## Example Scenario

1. Create an interface for the expression.
2. Create concrete classes that implement the expression interface.
3. Create a class that will interpret the expression (Interpreter).
4. Use the interpreter pattern to interpret expressions.

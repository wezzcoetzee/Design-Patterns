# Visitor 

## Definition

The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It is particularly useful when you want to perform various operations on a group of similar objects without modifying their classes.

## Example Scenario

Lets use the Visitor Pattern in C# using a shopping cart system with different types of items and discounts.

1. Define the visitor interface.
2. Define the item classes and the accept method.
3. Create the concrete visitor classes for different types of discounts.

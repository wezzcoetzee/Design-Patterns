# Abstract Factory

## Definition

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes. It allows you to create objects that belong to a family without specifying their concrete classes.

## Example Scenario

Let's consider a real-world example involving UI components for different operating systems.

Suppose we're developing a cross-platform application that needs to have a consistent look and feel on multiple operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. We can use the Abstract Factory pattern to create UI components like buttons, checkboxes, and textboxes, specific to each operating system.

1. Define an interface for each UI component
2. Implement concrete classes for each UI component for each operating system
3. Define an abstract factory interface that declares methods for creating each UI component
4. Implement concrete factories for each operating system that return concrete UI components

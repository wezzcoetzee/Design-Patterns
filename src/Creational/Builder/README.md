# Builder

## Description

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the step-by-step construction of complex objects using a specific sequence of actions. It's particularly useful when you need to create an object with many optional or required parameters, and you want to avoid the telescoping constructor anti-pattern.

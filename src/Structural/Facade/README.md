# Facade

## Definition

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## Example Scenario

You have a home automation system that controls various aspects of your home such as lights, heating, and security. Each of these subsystems has its own complex API. To make it easier for users to interact with the system, you can create a facade that provides a simplified interface

1. Create a `HomeAutomationFacade` class that provides a simplified interface to the home automation system.
2. Create subsystem classes that represent the various aspects of the home automation system.
3. Use the Facade pattern to interact with the home automation system.

# Composite

## Description

The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is particularly useful when dealing with hierarchical structures or when you need to perform operations on the whole structure as well as individual elements. In C#, you can implement the Composite pattern using an interface or an abstract class to represent the common methods for individual and composite objects.

## Example Scenario

A menu system in a restaurant application

1. Create an interface for the menu components.
2. Create a `MenuItem` class that represents individual menu items.
3. Create a `Menu` class that represents composite menu components.
4. Use the Composite pattern to create and print menus.
